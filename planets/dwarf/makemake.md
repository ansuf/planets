Makemake (minor-planet designation 136472 Makemake) is a likely dwarf planet and perhaps the second largest Kuiper belt object in the classical population,[a] with a diameter approximately two-thirds that of Pluto.[20][21] Makemake has one known satellite, S/2015 (136472) 1.[22] Makemake's extremely low average temperature, about 40 K (−230 °C), means its surface is covered with methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices.
