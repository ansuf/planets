<ol>

    <li><a href="/planets">Dwarf</a></li>
    <p>a <strong>dwarf planet</strong> is, “a celestial body orbiting a star that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity</p>


    <li><a href="/planets">Terrestrial</a></li>
    <p>A <strong>terrestrial planet</strong>, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals.</p>


    <li><a href="/planets">Gas Giant</a></li>

        <p>A team of scientists led by Carole Haswell and Daniel Staab of the U.K.'s Open University tried out their new search method using a 3.6-meter telescope in Chile. Relying on an instrument called a spectrograph, they zeroed in on a star about 200 light-years away. .</p>

        <p>The new planets are called K2-293b and K2-294b. The first is about 2.5 times as big around as Earth, the second about 1.7 times. K2-293b orbits a star about 1,300 light years away, K2-294b orbits a star a little over 1,200 light years distant.</p>

        <p>The planet stands out, visible as a bright point to the right of the center of the image. The black circle in the center is a part of the telescope called a coronagraph, which blocks the blinding light of the star. If the Very Large Telescope did not have a coronagraph, the star’s glare would drown out the fainter light of the planet, hiding it from our view.</p>
