<h2>Types of Planets</h2>

<ol>
    
        <li>
            <a href="/planets/planets/gas-giant">Gas Giant</a>
            <p>A <strong>giant planet</strong> composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Gas giants are sometimes known as failed stars because they contain the same basic elements as a star. Jupiter and Saturn are the gas giants of the Solar System.</p>

        </li>
    
        <li>
            <a href="/planets/planets/terrestrial">Terrestrial</a>
            <p>A <strong>terrestrial planet</strong>, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.</p>

        </li>
    
        <li>
            <a href="/planets/planets/dwarf">Dwarf</a>
            <p>a <strong>dwarf planet</strong> is, “a celestial body orbiting a star that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity but has not cleared its neighboring region of planetesimals and is not a satellite</p>

<h1>Recently Discovered Planets</h1>

<ul>
    
    <li>
        <a href="/planets/discovery/2020/02/21/this-four-planet-system-is-bleeding/">This Four-planet System is Bleeding</a>
        <p>A team of scientists led by Carole Haswell and Daniel Staab of the U.K.'s Open University tried out their new search method using a 3.6-meter telescope in Chile. Relying on an instrument called a spectrograph, they zeroed in on a star about 200 light-years away. .</p>

        <a href="/planets/discovery/2019/05/05/discovery-alert-two-planets-found-by-ai/">Discovery Alert! Two new planets – found by AI</a>
        <p>The new planets are called K2-293b and K2-294b. The first is about 2.5 times as big around as Earth, the second about 1.7 times. K2-293b orbits a star about 1,300 light years away, K2-294b orbits a star a little over 1,200 light years distant.</p>

        <a href="/planets/discovery/2018/07/03/baby-pictures-of-newborn-giant-planet/">Baby pictures of newborn giant planet</a>
        <p>The planet stands out, visible as a bright point to the right of the center of the image. The black circle in the center is a part of the telescope called a coronagraph, which blocks the blinding light of the star. If the Very Large Telescope did not have a coronagraph, the star’s glare would drown out the fainter light of the planet, hiding it from our view.</p>
