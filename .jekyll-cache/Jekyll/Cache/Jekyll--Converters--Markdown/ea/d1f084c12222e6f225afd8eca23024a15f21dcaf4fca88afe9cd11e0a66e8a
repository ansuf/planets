I"<p>For years, a group of scientists had been looking through the night sky for a special kind of murky, dim star. These stars don’t emit much light, so they are pretty hard to find.</p>

<p>What they did find was even more unlikely. They came across a planet. There are planets zipping around many stars in our galaxy. This one was different. It was hanging out all by its lonesome—drifting aimlessly in space without a star to warm it or keep it company.</p>

<p>When most people think of planets, they think of large spheres of rock (like Earth), ice (like Neptune), or gas (like Jupiter) circling around a bright, warming star. That makes sense. Planets form from the material left over from when a star is born.</p>

<p>But this object has everything else you might expect from a planet. In fact, it appears to be a lot like Jupiter, only much bigger.</p>

<p>So what is this super-Jupiter doing way out in the middle of nowhere? Gravitational forces might have flung it away from a star, leaving it to fly off into space. Or perhaps this planet formed in an entirely different and unknown way. Scientists don’t know for sure!</p>
