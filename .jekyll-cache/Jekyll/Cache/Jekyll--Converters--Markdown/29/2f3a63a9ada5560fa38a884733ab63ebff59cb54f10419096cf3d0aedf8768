I"ˆ	<p>Planets: DMPP-1 d, e, c and b</p>

<p>The discovery: Three â€œhot super-Earthsâ€ and a â€œwarm Neptuneâ€ orbit a relatively nearby, bright star not unlike our own Sun, a new study suggests. One or more of these planets is so thoroughly cooked that its atmosphere appears to be leaking into space â€“ in fact, thatâ€™s how astronomers found these planets using a brand-new detection method.</p>

<p>Key facts: DMPP-1 belongs to the class of stars labeled â€œFâ€: a bit larger and hotter than our Sun, which is a â€œGâ€-type star. DMPP-1 is also more yellow-white than our yellow star. The name itself stands for the â€œDispersed Matter Planet Project,â€ and itâ€™s the first star with planets detected by searching for the gas that theyâ€™re venting into space.</p>

<p>Details: A team of scientists led by Carole Haswell and Daniel Staab of the U.K.â€™s Open University tried out their new search method using a 3.6-meter telescope in Chile. Relying on an instrument called a spectrograph, they zeroed in on a star about 200 light-years away. The spectrograph can reveal what types of gases are present in a planetary system, and in this case, found evidence of a possible â€œcircumstellar gas shroudâ€ â€“ a diffuse cloud of gas orbiting the star, likely bleeding into space from one or more of the inner, â€œsuper Earthâ€ planets. The team used radial velocity measurements, which track the wobbles of a star caused by the gravity of orbiting planets, to estimate the size and number of planets in this system.</p>

<p>Fun facts: The planet, or planets, that are leaking gas could shed light on the â€œNeptune desertâ€ â€“ an orbital region so close to a star that Neptune-type planets migrating inward from the outer reaches of the system would have their atmospheres stripped away, leaving behind nothing but a rocky core. Itâ€™s possible the gas-hemorrhaging planet, or planets, are in the late stages of this process.</p>

<p>The discoverers: The overall Dispersed Matter Planet Project Survey, led by Haswell, used the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph on the European Southern Observatoryâ€™s 3.6-meter telescope in La Silla, Chile. This international science team studied stars now known as DMPP-1, 2 and 3. The paper on DMPP-1, led by Staab, was published in â€œNature Astronomyâ€ in December 2019, and the discoveries were entered into the NASA Exoplanet Archive in January 2020.</p>
